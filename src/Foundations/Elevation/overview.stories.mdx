#### FOUNDATIONS
# Elevation
###### Elevation represents our user interface elevation layers which create a clear hierarchy of interface elements. This makes it easier to locate currently available interactive options for the user.

### Elevation

###### Elevation is used to imply elevation of an element on the page by placing all elements within a 3D plane. Depth is created along the z-axis of objects relative to other surfaces by applying shadows. 
###### The objects that are closer to the user have a lifted or higher shadow affordance that aids users in knowing they can be interacted with. 
###### Objects that are further away from the user not intended to be interacted with have no elevation and appear static.
###### By applying shadows in this way, we increase the ability for users to find and identify interactive components while scanning a page.

### Elevation layers and matrix
###### Use our Elevation layers and matrix to understand a quick overview of how to apply shadow to imply elevation in our product consistently.
