# Typography
Typography represents our font and set type styling to create clear, consistent, and accessible hierarchy through the Whatfix product. 


## Our font
[Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter#standard-styles) is the font we use on the Whatfix product ecosystem. It is a variable font family [carefully crafted & designed](https://www.figma.com/blog/the-birth-of-inter) for computer screens. 

Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well, like contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate "0" from "o", tabular numbers, etc.

## Applying accessible hierarchy
- Use unique, descriptive, and clear headings and titles.
- Use an h1 for page titles.
- Don’t skip heading levels. An h3 should follow an h2, and so on. Customers who use assistive technology like screen readers can then listen to a list of all headings, and skip to a desired heading to begin reading at that point. 
- Organizing web pages by headings helps users get a sense of the page’s organization and structure with headings presented as larger and more distinct than surrounding text.
- Minimize the number of type sizes to 5 or less in any given viewport if possible.
