###### FOUNDATIONS
# [Colors](https://navi.whatfix.com/390bbdcd7/p/07ffac-colors/b/265f62)
###### We use a purposeful palette of colors to distinguish our brand, create consistency, and promote visual recognition across different contexts.

## Semantic and Intent
Semantic colors have specific intents assigned to them and are used sparingly and consistently throughout Whatfix to reinforce their specific meaning. 

### Success |  SuccesSage
To highlight the positivity and celebration of completing a task, we use vibrant green success colors.

### Warning | Yell-uh-oh
To highlight that an issue needs corrective action or could be avoided, we use yellow warning colors.
<DesignTokenDocBlock categoryName="Warning" viewType="card" />

### Critical | Scare-let
To highlight the consequences of a negative or destructive action like delete, we use critical red colors.
