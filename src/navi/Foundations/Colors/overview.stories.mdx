# Colors
We use a purposeful palette of colors to distinguish our brand and create consistency and visual recognition across different contexts.

# Our palettes
## Primary
Our [primary palette](/story/foundations-colors-primary--page) includes our brand call to action color which is used to convey the highest impact actions on the page. 

## Secondary
Our [secondary palette](/story/foundations-colors-secondary--page) highlights medium and lower-impact actions or elements like inactive buttons or secondary text. It also includes neutral tints and shades derived from Inkcredible that we use to create depth within components and patterns. 

## Semantic and Intent
Our [semantic and intent palettes](/story/foundations-colors-semantic-and-intent--page) have specific value states assigned to them and are used sparingly and consistently throughout Whatfix to reinforce their meaning. They cover value states like success, warning, negative or destructive, information and progress.

## Brand
Our [brand palette](/story/foundations-colors-brand--page) is used intentionally for moments of impact like the beginning of flows in branded moments with illustrations or with larger iconography that make the product “feel” like Whatfix. 

# Accessibility
We have indicated whether or not each color meets WCAG contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for 16 px or higher for light and dark within each color chip. Note that if white passes over the color fill this also means the color can be used as a text color over white and meet accessibility needs. 

# Color Matrix
Use our color matrix to understand a quick overview of how to use color in our product.
