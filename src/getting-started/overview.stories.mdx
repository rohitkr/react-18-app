# Navi Design System

## Overview
**Design system** is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.
**Storybook** is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.
**Chromatic** automates gathering UI feedback, visual testing, and documentation, so developers can iterate faster with less manual work.
Chromatic is enabled in the component library repo and can be accessed using the below URL:
https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=6226f2346f3442003a5bf561
Use the Whatfix bitbucket account to login to chromatic. 
### Goals
1. Design team and developer can work together and deliver the UI component faster
2. Setup the contribution process to the UI component library
3. Setup the review process
4. Enable developers to use components from the UI components library

### Workflow
All the reusable UI components should be developed in the new ui-component repository and a proper storybook must be written by the developer for the UI component. A unit test should also be written for that component. Once the development is complete and a pull request is created. Chromatic will automatically trigger the build and publish the storybook and a notification will be sent to a slack channel automatically. The stakeholder/design team will get notification through slack channel and will review the component.
