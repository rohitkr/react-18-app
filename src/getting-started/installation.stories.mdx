At the time of release, this package will be published in a private npm registery.

For development you can use `yalc` to publish the package and install the dependencies from your local machine without publishing this packages to the remote registry.

yalc acts as very simple local repository for your locally developed packages that you want to share across your local environment.

Step 1. run `yalc publish` in the package directory, it grabs only files that should be published to NPM and puts them in a special global store.

Step 2. run `yalc add navi-design-system` in your project where you want to use this UI components.

Step 3. Run `yalc update navi-design-system` to update the latest version from store.
